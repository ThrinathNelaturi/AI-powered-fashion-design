# AI-powered-fashion-design
This solution leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to revolutionize the fashion industry through AI-powered fashion design and virtual fitting. By integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Text-to-Image Generation, the system allows users to design clothing and accessories interactively, receiving real-time feedback and visualizations of given patterns and designs. VQA enables users to ask detailed questions about fashion elements and receive insightful answers, while Text-to-Image Generation tries to create accurate visual representations of the described outfits. This innovative approach enhances the design process, providing a seamless, interactive experience for both designers and consumers.
